## 📌 Overview

Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement, speech, and motor control. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving treatment outcomes and quality of life.

In this project, machine learning models are trained on clinical voice data to classify whether a person is likely to have Parkinson’s disease based on extracted voice features.

## ⚙️ Methodology

1. **Data Loading**  
   The dataset containing clinical patient data is loaded and inspected for structure and quality.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Statistical analysis and visualizations are performed to understand feature distributions and patterns.

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values (if any)
   - Feature scaling and normalization
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

4. **Model Training**  
   Machine learning classification models are trained using the processed data.

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix to assess performance.
